      "answer": "The concept of balance indicates the position of the agent with respect to the parent company. An agent with a negative balance owes the negative amount to the parent company, while an agent with a positive balance would expect to collect that amount from the parent company.<br/><br>Let's see an example:<br/><br><img src=\"/images/download50.png\" alt=\"Date Filtering Example\" class=\"w-full image-popup imgsize  xl:max-2xl:w-[50%] sm:w-[50%] h-full rounded-md mt-4\"/><br/>An agent with:<br/><br>- Balance -S/5,000, you should transfer those S/5,000 to the parent company, in order to remain at S/0. Without debt.<br/>- Balance S/5,000 indicates that the agent is owed by the parent company S/5,000.<br/>- A balance with S/0 indicates that the agent does not owe and is not owed money.<br/><br>The limit balance is represented in negative, since it is the maximum amount that an agent can owe to the parent company"
